This project demonstrates the fundamentals of CSS, including styling text, backgrounds, buttons, and layout elements. It also focuses on understanding the **CSS Box Model**—how `margin`, `padding`, and `border` affect the layout and spacing of elements.

## Files

## Features

- Clean and maintainable CSS code with comments.
